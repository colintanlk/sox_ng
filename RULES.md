# Rules for the SoX_ng project

The "master copy" of the sox_ng codebase, if there is such a thing,
lives on Codeberg.

You can browse it online at
[`codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng`](https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng)
and fetch a copy by
```
git clone https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng.git
```

There are no other rules except for the GPL and, when modifying the code,
to follow the existing style in its bizarre formatting and dense grammar.

See also the rules [for the wiki](RULES-wiki)
and [for the issues](RULES-issues).
