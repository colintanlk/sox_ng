Scripts to manage sox_ng's download of its issue database

getissues.sh
	Downloads the issues into this directory.

makehtml.sh
	Makes HTML files from the downloaded .md files
	and an index.html listing them.

clean.sh
	Removes files generated by makehtml.sh

	With -a ("akk"it also removes issues whose .md file hasn't been modified
	since it was downloaded.
	It knows this from the modification dates of the .md file and its
	corresponding directory so if you add something to an issue's metadata
	and don't want it removed by "./clean.sh -a",
	remember to touch the corresponding .md file afterwards.

	With -a -f it removes all downloaded issues. Caveat emptor.
