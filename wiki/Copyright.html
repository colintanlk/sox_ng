<h1 id="copyright">Copyright</h1>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>SoX is GPL2-only because <code>src/opus.c</code> is based on <code>oggenc.c</code> which is GPL2
so the work as a whole is GPL2.
Individual source files have further licence terms which should be
respected if they are reused.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a look.</p>

<h2 id="blanketcopyrightstatement">Blanket copyright statement</h2>

<p>SoX&#8217;s <code>COPYING</code> file reads:</p>

<pre><code>SoX source code is distributed under two main licenses. The two
licenses are in the files LICENSE.GPL and LICENSE.LGPL.

sox.c, and thus SoX-the user application, is distributed under the
GPL, while the files that make up libsox are licensed under the less
restrictive LGPL.
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>LICENSE.GPL</code> is the GPL Version 2 or later and
<code>LICENSE.LGPL</code> is the LGPL Version 2.1 or later.</p>

<p>The top level <code>Makefile.am</code> and <code>configure.ac</code> and
<code>src/{Makefile.am,optional-fmts.am}</code> have no copyright notice.</p>

<h2 id="lpc10">lpc10</h2>

<p><code>lpc10</code> is a low bandwidth speech codec by the US Department of Defense
whose source code is included in SoX.</p>

<p>No files in 14.4.2&#8217;s <code>lpc10/</code> directory contain copyright statements
and were derived by translating the original Fortran code to C using <code>f2c</code>
and hand-editing the results.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jafingerhut/lpc10/blob/main/original-code">original Fortran code</a>
was written by the US Department of Defense, its file modification times
range from February 1990 to October 1993 and it contains no copyright notices
but its <code>README</code> file is headed</p>

<pre><code>                            U.S. Department of Defense
                         LPC-10 2400 bps Voice Coder
                                     Release 1.0
                                     October 1993
</code></pre>

<p>and its FAQ file says</p>

<pre><code>The &quot;AD&quot; ordering number for the CELP software is AD M000 118
(US$ 90.00) and for the TIB it's AD A256 629 (US$ 17.50).    The LPC-10
standard, described below, is FIPS Pub 137 (US$ 12.50).    There is a
$3.00 shipping charge on all U.S. orders.    The telephone number for
their automated system is 703-487-4650, or 703-487-4600 if you'd prefer
to talk with a real person.

(U.S. DoD personnel and contractors can receive the package from the
Defense Technical Information Center:    DTIC, Building 5, Cameron
Station, Alexandria, VA 22304-6145.    Their telephone number is
703-274-7633.)

<p>It was translated to C from February to October 1996 and is maintained
<a href="https://github.com/jafingerhut/lpc10">on github</a> by its translator
who wrote in its <code>README</code> file:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because of the history of this implementation, the copyright
and license status is still not completely clear to me,
for reasons discussed further below. It might be in the
public domain, but if the legal answer matters to you
in any significant way, I suggest consulting an attorney
who specialies in intellectual property law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Legal advice from the FSF:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Works of the US may be considered public domain
(IIRC, they are technically uncopyrightable), but the fact that
it&#8217;s a work of the US should ideally be checked, and a note added
in the files in question.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If the translation is made with a grain of creativity,
its authors may hold copyright on it independently,
therefore their separate permission is needed for the work to be free.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Work of the US&#8221; means that it is legally a work of the state.</p>

the BSD 3-clause new or revised license.</p>

contains a modified version of sox-14.4.2 which adds a missing copyright
statement for libgsm that was removed when the library was imported into SoX.</p>

<h2 id="optionallibraries">Optional libraries</h2>

<p>SoX&#8217;s <code>COPYING</code> file says:</p>

<pre><code>Note that some of the external packages that can be linked into libsox
are GPLed and/or may have licensing problems, so they can be disabled
at configure time with the relevant--with-* options. If libsox is built
with such libraries, it must be distributed under the GPL.
</code></pre>

<p>and an FSF representative writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to check what the real licenses are, and update INSTALL
(or SoX programs if they turn out GPL-incompatible).
For example, &#8216;GPL&#8217; may mean GPLv2-only, making it non-compliant
with Savannah hosting requirements (GPLv3 or later).</p>
