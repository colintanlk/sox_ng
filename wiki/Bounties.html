<h1 id="bounties">Bounties</h1>

<p>If someone wants a bug fixed, a limit removed,
a feature implemented or existing work applied and tested
but don&#8217;t have time to do it, they can declare
a bounty on it, put some money into <a href="Accounting.html">SoX_ng&#8217;s account</a> and
announce it on <a href="https://groups.io/g/sox-ng">the SoX_ng mailing list</a>
or <a href="mailto:sox_ng@fastmail.com">mail sox_ng privately</a></p>

<p>When the money arrives, the issue gains a <code>bounty</code> label
and when the change is approved and committed,
the money goes to whoever sorted it out.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng/issues?labels=240313&amp;state=open">the currently open bounties</a>.</p>
