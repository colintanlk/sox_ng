# Bounties

If someone wants a bug fixed, a limit removed,
a feature implemented or existing work applied and tested
but don't have time to do it, they can declare
a bounty on it, put some money into [SoX_ng's account](Accounting) and
announce it on [the SoX_ng mailing list](https://groups.io/g/sox-ng)
or [mail sox_ng privately](mailto:sox_ng@fastmail.com)

When the money arrives, the issue gains a `bounty` label
and when the change is approved and committed,
the money goes to whoever sorted it out.

Here are [the currently open bounties](https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng/issues?labels=240313&state=open).
