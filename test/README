Yet another test suite for SoX
------------------------------

There are already several test suites in sox's source directory
as well as a test/ directory (which doesn't seem to work).

This one is a regression test suite, most of which test CVE's against
crafted audio files, each with its files in its own directory.

To run all the tests:

    sh check.sh

or to run an individual test:

    cd CVE-2004-0557
    sh run

You can also test a different executable than the installed "sox" by saying:

    sox=/usr/local/src/sox-14.4.2/src/sox sh check.sh
or
    sox=/usr/local/bin/sox sh run

but relative paths will only work properly with "sh run" as check.sh
cd's into the various directories before running "run" in each one.

If you get unrecognised exit statuses on funny systems, do write.
