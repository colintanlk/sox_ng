Legend
OK   The test succeeded and sox succeeded or failed as it should
SUCC sox "succeeded" (exit 0) when it should have failed (exit 2)
ABRT sox Aborted (core dumped)
SEGV sox got a Segmentation fault (core dumped)
FPE  sox got a Floating Point Exception (core dumped)
LOOP sox ran for more than one minute of CPU.
EXEC Can't execute the sox binary. Missing shared libraries also provoke this.
VOID This test cannot be run with the sox you have installed
ASAN The Address Sanitizer reports problems other than memory leaks:
     buffer overflows, freeing free memory, allocating until running out of VM.
     It means exit(1), which sox only gives for command-line syntax errors.
     Other failures (SEGV, FPE etc) will be caught by ASAN in such builds.
     You will also get an ASAN error if your sox wasn't built with support
     for the input or output format, in which case it exits 1.
