# README.md

This is my fork of the sox_ng project to be able to to be ported to Macos 
patching failed everytime
The `SoX_ng` project imports, compares and refines bug fixes and new work 
from the 50-odd software distributions that package SoX
and from the plethora of forks on github and elsewhere
and makes regular releases with a six-monthly cadence
for each of the micro (bug fixes) and minor (new features) releases.
A major release (non-backwards-compatible changes) is being considered.

The next micro release is scheduled for the 18th February 2025.<BR>
The first minor release is scheduled for the 18th November 2024.

## Terminology

`sox` means [sox.sf.net](http://sox.sf.net)<BR>
`SoX` means the Swiss Army Knife of command-line audio processing in any of its incarnations<BR>
`sox_ng` means the hard fork of `sox-14.4.2` aiming to sanitize `SoX`<BR>
`SoX_ng` means the project to maintain `sox_ng`

## How to get it

`sox_ng` lives at
[codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng](https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng)
and is composed of a SoX code base, a wiki and an issue tracker.

### Releases

Download one of the
[release tarballs](https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng/releases).

Extract it:
```
tar xzf sox_ng-*.tar.gz
```
Build it:
```
./configure
make
```
Install it:
```
make install
```

It installs as `sox_ng` so that `sox` and `sox_ng` can
coexist on the same system.
For it to work the same as the original `sox`, use
`./configure --enable-replace` instead.

### Development branches

#### main

To fetch the latest version:
```
git clone https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng
cd sox_ng
autoreconf -i
```
and to make local copies of the wiki and the issues:
```
git clone https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/sox_ng.wiki wiki
issues/getissues.sh
```

To compile it:
```
./configure
make
```
and to install it:
```
sudo make install
```
This installs it as `sox_ng`, `sox_ng.h`, `libsox_ng` and so on, so as
not to conflict with traditional `sox`. If you want it to work the same
as the original `sox`, use `./configure --enable-replace`

## Build dependencies

To compile a release tarball you will need `make`, `libtool`
and `gcc` or `clang` (`./configure CC=clang`)

To build the git repository you will also need `autoconf` and `automake`.

To enable all of SoX's optional modules you can install
`ladspa-sdk`
`lame`,
`libao`,
`libflac`,
`libid3tag`,
`libmad`,
`libogg`,
`libopusfile`,
`libpng`,
`libsndfile`,
`libvorbis`,
`opencore-amr`,
`twolame`,
`wavpack`.

### Debian, Ubuntu etc.
```
apt-get install gcc make libtool ladspa-sdk libao-dev libasound2-dev libgsm1-dev libid3tag0-dev libltdl-dev libmad0-dev libmagic-dev libmp3lame-dev libopencore-amrnb-dev libopencore-amrwb-dev libopusfile-dev libpng-dev libpulse-dev libsamplerate0-dev libsndfile1-dev libtwolame-dev libvorbis-dev libwavpack-dev
```
and to run `issues/getissues.sh` and `makehtml.sh`
```
apt-get install jq libtext-multimarkdown-perl
```

### Fedora, Red Hat, CentOS etc.
```
yum install gcc make libtool libvorbis-devel alsa-lib-devel libtool-ltdl-devel libsamplerate-devel gsm-devel wavpack-devel ladspa-devel libpng-devel flac-devel libao-devel libsndfile-devel libid3tag-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel opusfile-devel libtool libmad-devel lame-devel twolame-devel opencore-amr-devel file-devel libcaca-devel
```
and to run `issues/getissues.sh` and `makehtml.sh`
```
yum install jq multimarkdown
```

## Accessibility

You can edit and commit to the code and the wiki using Codeberg's web interface
or from the command-line. The command-line is the only way to add images
and attachments to the wiki.

The issues are currently read-only to the command line
and editable only on the Codeberg web site. This will change.
